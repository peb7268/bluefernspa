		Our Public Adjuster's final report contains all supporting documentation for items being claimed. All reports are completed using the industry standard in estimating software, Xactimate. We use the latest in thermal imaging/infrared technology to detect damage not normally visible.  This offers a significant advantage in detecting damage or preventing problems. Hi-Tech Moisture meters allows us to determine the percentage of water remaining in the structure.

		There are no up front costs.  We at LRG-Loss Recovery Group receive only a small percentage of the final settlement.  We do not get paid unless and until you get paid!

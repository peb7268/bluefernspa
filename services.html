			Our Mission at LRG- Loss Recovery Group, LLC is to get business owners and homeowners the maximum property claim settlement you deserve! The claims process can be a painful, financial nightmare for policyholders. When the policyholder incurs a loss, we manage every detail of the claim to get the most equitable and prompt settlement possible.  Let our Professional Public Adjusters handle it for you!

	 		<p>
			We will Review your coverage, perform a complete inspection, file necessary documents, negotiate and settle your claim. Policyholders can count on our Public Adjusters expertise and services including Free Damage Inspections, Loss Documentation, Claim Package Preparation, Insurance Adjusting, and Negotiations. We handle claims for Residential and Commercial property owners.

			Our Public Adjuster's final report contains all supporting documentation for items being claimed. All reports are completed using the industry standard in estimating software, Xactimate. We use the latest in thermal imaging/infrared technology to detect damage not normally visible.  This offers a significant advantage in detecting damage or preventing problems. Hi-Tech Moisture meters allows us to determine the percentage of water remaining in the structure.

			There are no up front costs.  We at LRG-Loss Recovery Group receive only a small percentage of the final settlement.  We do not get paid unless and until you get paid!  It is in everyone's best interest that your claim gets settled quickly, for the maximum amount possible, under the terms of your policy. As your Public Adjusting firm, we will make sure it happens.
